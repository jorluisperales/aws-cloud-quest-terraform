 
Here you'll find a series of terraform codes based on the activities/labs available on the:
### AWS Cloud Quest | Interactive Role-Playing Game
(https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/)

NOTE: I performed this based on the tasks/steps we have to make during this training through the AWS GUI console.

Theses codes are for testing in your own aws cloud.

Feel free to fork and star this repo and help improving the codes
